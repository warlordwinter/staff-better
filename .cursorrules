# Engineering Principles for Cursor AI

This document defines core principles to ensure consistent, high-quality engineering practices when using Cursor AI for development tasks.

## Core Principles

### 1. Follow Good Engineering Practices

- Write clear, maintainable, and well-structured code.
- Prioritize readability and simplicity.
- Use consistent naming conventions and formatting.

### 2. Always Provide Pseudocode Before Implementation

- Before writing any code, provide detailed pseudocode or an outline of the approach.
- Ensure the logic and steps are clear before coding.
- Use pseudocode to validate understanding of the problem.

### 3. Request Review Before Code Changes

- Always ask for a code review before adding or changing any code.
- Make sure changes align with project goals and coding standards.
- Use reviews to catch potential issues early.

### 4. Document Thought Process and Justifications

- Explain the rationale behind architectural or implementation decisions.
- Clarify assumptions and trade-offs made in the design.

### 5. Test and Validate Thoroughly

- Ensure all code is covered by appropriate tests.
- Validate edge cases and possible failure scenarios.
- Verify that security and compliance requirements are met.

### 6. Collaborate and Communicate Clearly

- Ask clarifying questions when requirements or constraints are unclear.
- Use precise language and avoid ambiguity in explanations.
