# Groups Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full database integration for the Groups feature with company-scoped groups, many-to-many associate relationships, and SMS messaging capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**Location:** `database-migrations/001_create_groups_tables.sql`

Created two new tables:
- **`groups`**: Stores group information
  - Linked to companies via `company_id` foreign key
  - Includes name, description, timestamps
  - Cascade deletes when company is deleted
  
- **`group_members`**: Junction table for many-to-many relationships
  - Links groups to associates
  - Composite primary key (group_id, associate_id)
  - Cascade deletes when group or associate is deleted

### 2. TypeScript Types ✅
**Location:** `src/lib/database.types.ts`

Added type definitions for:
- `groups` table (Row, Insert, Update)
- `group_members` table (Row, Insert, Update)
- Proper relationship mappings

### 3. Authentication Helper ✅
**Location:** `src/lib/auth/getCompanyId.ts`

- `getCompanyId()`: Returns company ID or null
- `requireCompanyId()`: Returns company ID or throws error
- Used throughout API routes for company scoping

### 4. Data Access Layer (DAO) ✅
**Locations:**
- `src/lib/dao/interfaces/IGroups.ts` - Interface definition
- `src/lib/dao/implementations/supabase/GroupsDaoSupabase.ts` - Implementation

Methods implemented:
- `getGroups(companyId)` - Fetch all groups with member counts
- `getGroupById(groupId, companyId)` - Fetch single group
- `createGroup(...)` - Create new group
- `updateGroup(...)` - Update group details
- `deleteGroup(...)` - Delete group
- `getGroupMembers(...)` - Get all members of a group
- `addMember(...)` - Add single member to group
- `addMembers(...)` - Add multiple members to group
- `removeMember(...)` - Remove member from group

### 5. API Routes ✅

#### Groups CRUD
**`src/app/api/groups/route.ts`**
- GET: Fetch all groups for authenticated user's company
- POST: Create new group

**`src/app/api/groups/[id]/route.ts`**
- GET: Fetch specific group
- PUT: Update group
- DELETE: Delete group

#### Group Members Management
**`src/app/api/groups/[id]/members/route.ts`**
- GET: Fetch all members of a group
- POST: Add member(s) to group (supports single or batch)
- DELETE: Remove member from group (via query parameter)

#### Messaging
**`src/app/api/groups/[id]/message/route.ts`**
- POST: Send mass SMS to all group members
  - Filters out opted-out members
  - Handles Twilio integration
  - Returns detailed results

**`src/app/api/associates/[id]/message/route.ts`**
- POST: Send SMS to individual associate
  - Checks opt-out status
  - Validates phone number exists

### 6. Frontend Data Service ✅
**Location:** `src/lib/services/groupsDataService.ts`

Replaced all mock data with real API calls:
- All CRUD operations for groups
- All CRUD operations for associates
- Member management
- Individual and mass messaging

## Security Features

1. **Company Scoping**: All operations are scoped to the authenticated user's company
2. **Authorization Checks**: Groups can only be accessed/modified by their owning company
3. **Input Validation**: All API routes validate input data
4. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

## SMS Messaging Features

1. **Individual Messaging**: Send SMS to any associate
2. **Mass Messaging**: Send SMS to all members of a group
3. **Opt-out Handling**: Automatically filters out associates who opted out
4. **Phone Validation**: Checks for valid phone numbers
5. **Rate Limiting**: Small delays between messages to respect Twilio limits
6. **Error Reporting**: Detailed results showing success/failure for each message

## How to Use

### 1. Apply Database Migration
Follow instructions in `database-migrations/README.md` to create the tables.

### 2. Test the Feature

#### Create a Group
```typescript
// The UI already handles this, or via API:
POST /api/groups
{
  "name": "Forklift Operators",
  "description": "Certified forklift drivers"
}
```

#### Add Associates to Group
```typescript
// The UI handles this when creating associates in a group, or via API:
POST /api/groups/{groupId}/members
{
  "associate_id": "uuid-here"
}

// Or add multiple:
POST /api/groups/{groupId}/members
{
  "associate_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"]
}
```

#### Send Individual Message
```typescript
// Click the message icon on an associate row, or via API:
POST /api/associates/{associateId}/message
{
  "message": "Don't forget about tomorrow's shift!"
}
```

#### Send Mass Message
```typescript
// Click "Message All" button, or via API:
POST /api/groups/{groupId}/message
{
  "message": "Reminder: Safety training this Friday at 2 PM"
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply database migration
- [ ] Create a new group
- [ ] Add associates to the group (create new or add existing)
- [ ] View group details and member list
- [ ] Edit group name/description
- [ ] Send individual message to an associate
- [ ] Send mass message to all group members
- [ ] Delete an associate from a group
- [ ] Delete a group
- [ ] Verify company scoping (groups from other companies shouldn't be visible)

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/groups` | List all groups for company |
| POST | `/api/groups` | Create new group |
| GET | `/api/groups/{id}` | Get specific group |
| PUT | `/api/groups/{id}` | Update group |
| DELETE | `/api/groups/{id}` | Delete group |
| GET | `/api/groups/{id}/members` | List group members |
| POST | `/api/groups/{id}/members` | Add member(s) to group |
| DELETE | `/api/groups/{id}/members?associate_id={id}` | Remove member from group |
| POST | `/api/groups/{id}/message` | Send mass message to group |
| POST | `/api/associates/{id}/message` | Send message to individual |

## Known Limitations

1. **Message History**: Currently messages are sent but not stored in the database (as per requirements - "we will change that later")
2. **Associate Update**: When updating an associate, the groupId cannot be changed (would need to remove from one group and add to another)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Basic 100ms delay between messages; may need adjustment for large groups

## Future Enhancements

1. Add message history tracking table
2. Add message templates
3. Add scheduled messages
4. Add message delivery status tracking
5. Add ability to move associates between groups
6. Add bulk import of associates to groups
7. Add group analytics (message stats, member activity, etc.)

## Conclusion
