# Authentication Fix Applied

## Problem
You were experiencing a PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) authentication error:
```
code challenge does not match previously saved code verifier
```

This error occurred because Server Actions don't properly set cookies before redirecting, which broke the PKCE flow.

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
**Improper cookie handling in API routes during OAuth PKCE flow**

The issue had two parts:

1. **Server Actions Problem**: The original implementation used Server Actions which don't properly set cookies before redirecting
2. **API Route Cookie Handling**: API Route Handlers need special cookie handling - they can't use `cookies()` from `next/headers` like Server Components can

When `signInWithOAuth()` is called, Supabase generates a PKCE code verifier and needs to store it in a cookie. In API routes, this cookie must be explicitly copied to the redirect response, or it gets lost.

### The Fix: Proper API Route Cookie Management

**Created:**
- `src/lib/supabase/route-handler.ts` - Special Supabase client factory for API routes that properly handles cookies through request/response cycle
- `src/app/api/auth/signin-google/route.ts` - GET endpoint for Google OAuth
- `src/app/api/auth/signin-azure/route.ts` - GET endpoint for Azure OAuth

**Updated:**
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Changed from Server Action forms to Link components
- `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Updated to use the new route-handler client

**Why This Works:**
The `route-handler.ts` client creates a response object that captures all cookies set by Supabase, and we explicitly copy those cookies to every redirect response. This ensures:
1. PKCE code verifier cookie is set when OAuth flow starts
2. The cookie is included in the redirect to the OAuth provider
3. The cookie is present when the callback returns
4. Session cookies are properly set after successful authentication

## How The PKCE Flow Works

1. **Login initiated**: User clicks "Continue with Google/Microsoft"
2. **API Route Handler**: Calls `signInWithOAuth()` which generates and stores PKCE verifier in cookie
3. **OAuth redirect**: User authenticates with provider
4. **Callback**: Provider redirects back with auth code
5. **Callback handler**: Retrieves PKCE verifier from cookie and exchanges code for session
6. **Success**: User is authenticated

## Testing the Fix

### IMPORTANT: Clear Everything First

**This is critical** - old cookies and cached state WILL cause the same error. You must:

1. **Close ALL browser windows/tabs** running localhost:3000
2. **Clear browser data** for localhost:
   - Open a new browser window
   - Press F12 (DevTools)
   - Go to Application tab (Chrome) or Storage tab (Firefox)
   - Right-click on "Cookies" → Clear
   - Right-click on "Local Storage" → Clear
   - Right-click on "Session Storage" → Clear
3. **Restart your dev server**:
   ```bash
   # In your terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   # Wait for it to compile
   ```

### Test Authentication Flow

1. **Open a fresh incognito/private window** (even safer than clearing)
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Click **"Continue with Google"** or **"Continue with Microsoft"**
4. Complete the OAuth flow with your provider
5. **Expected Result:** 
   - ✅ Successful redirect back to your app
   - ✅ No "bad_code_verifier" error
   - ✅ Redirect to `/company-setup` (new users) or `/jobs` (existing users)

### What You Should See in Terminal

When it works correctly, you'll see:
```
GET /api/auth/signin-google 307 in XXms
GET /auth/callback/?code=XXXX 307 in XXms
Attempting to exchange code for session...
Session created successfully: your@email.com
User needs company setup, redirecting to setup page
  OR
Returning user, redirecting to jobs page
```

### If It Still Fails

If you still see the error after following the steps above, check:
1. Your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env variable is set to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Your Supabase redirect URLs include `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
3. You've restarted the dev server AND cleared browser data AND used incognito

## If Issues Persist

If you still have authentication issues, try these additional steps:

### 1. Check Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Check Supabase Auth Settings
In your Supabase dashboard:
- Go to Authentication → URL Configuration
- Make sure `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` is in the Redirect URLs list
- Site URL should be `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Use Incognito/Private Window
Sometimes cached auth state can cause issues. Try in a fresh incognito window.

### 4. Check Browser Console
Look for any CORS errors or cookie warnings in the browser console.

## Next Steps: Testing Groups Feature

Once authentication is working, you can test the Groups feature:

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy contents of `database-migrations/001_create_groups_tables.sql`
   - Run it

2. **Test Groups Functionality**
   - Navigate to `/groups`
   - Create a new group
   - Add associates to the group
   - Send individual messages
   - Send mass messages

See `GROUPS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed testing instructions.

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that Supabase's SSR package can properly set cookie attributes including:
- `httpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript access (security)
- `secure`: Requires HTTPS in production
- `sameSite`: Controls cross-site cookie behavior
- `path`: Cookie path scope
- `maxAge`: Cookie expiration

These attributes are critical for the PKCE flow to work correctly, especially `sameSite` which is important for OAuth redirects.
